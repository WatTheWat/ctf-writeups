# Happy Birthday
From the past few OSINT challenges we found Mirveal's mastodon account.

Now, however, we have to find his birth year and city.

The only thing we've found so far than can help us now is his full name, Akio Shiwaku.

Pulling up a handy OSINT website, https://osintframework.com/, we can see if anything to do with his name can help us find birth records. The tab under public records and birth records didn't get us anything with his name.

After a bit of digging I saw:

 https://www.familytreenow.com/ under -> People Search Engines -> General People Search.

Looks like this was the intended solution!
 
The flag is:
